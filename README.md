# CalculatorApp
A simple Calcualtor App created through the help of the Odin Project! (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator). It has all the basic calculator functionalities. 
Core concept dealing with this project is DOM Manipulation and java. 

# Technologies Used
- VS Code
- CSS 
- HTML
- Java

# Improvements
One of the main improvements I will make in my upcoming projects are adding more designs through the front end frameworks. The Calculator Project was a good start for
understanding DOM Manipulation but I think there's a lot of work to be done in the CSS field.
